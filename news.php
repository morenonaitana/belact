	    			<p class="news__new__desc__text p1">
							The Belgian Group for Animal Cell Technology (BELACT) will celebrate its 25th anniversary at the 25th European Society for Animal Cell Technology (ESACT) Meeting that will be held Lausanne, Switzerland on May 14 to 17, 2017. We will take this opportunity to reflect on the previous meetings organized by BELACT but also on the future of this association.
							<br /><br />
							We are looking for motivated Scientists, not only from Belgium, but also from the neighboring countries to join us and participate in the definition of the next roadmap for BELACT.
							Feel free to meet the team by attending the presentation that will be given by BELACT Chairman, Pr Yves-Jacques SCHNEIDER from the Catholic University of Louvain in Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium.
